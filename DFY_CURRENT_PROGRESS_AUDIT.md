# DFY — Complete Current Progress & Codebase Audit

**Audit date:** 2026-09-18  
**Repositories:** DFY-BE and DFY-FE  
**Baseline:** current `main` branches, with open hardening PRs tracked separately.

## Executive status

DFY is **not yet production-ready E2E**.

The direct-to-bank payout architecture is substantially implemented, but the codebase still contains FE/BE contract discrepancies, legacy wallet architecture, incomplete refund infrastructure, incomplete financial E2E validation, and important hardening changes that currently exist only in open PRs.

## Status legend

- ✅ Implemented / aligned
- 🟢 Implemented, but requires production validation
- 🟡 Partially implemented / discrepancy exists
- 🔴 Significant production blocker
- ❌ Missing
- ⚪ Legacy/dead functionality retained for migration compatibility

\* Open hardening PRs, not current main.

## Key discrepancies

### 1. TaskName contract

The Task model has TaskName, but the current main API contract does not consistently accept, persist and expose it. FE work already expects task names.

Relevant PRs:
- BE PR #10
- FE PR #11

### 2. Detailed task authorization

Sensitive task details need to be restricted to the creator, assigned runner or Admin. The hardening exists in BE PR #10 and is not yet on main.

### 3. Admin privileged actions

Verification, unverification, bulk verification, force escrow release and user verification changes need mandatory reasons and audit records.

Relevant PRs:
- BE PR #11
- FE PR #12

### 4. Admin deletion

Financially relevant tasks must not be hard-deleted when payment/escrow/payout/runner activity exists. Users should not be hard-deleted where audit/history must be preserved.

Relevant PR: BE PR #11.

### 5. FE/BE financial state mismatch

Backend uses a broader financial lifecycle than the FE types represent, including:

```text
Pending
EscrowHeld
EscrowReleased
PayoutPending
Processing
RunnerPaid
PayoutReturned
PayoutCancelled
PayoutFailed
DisputePending
```

The FE needs one authoritative representation rather than loose strings and aliases.

### 6. Wallet retirement is incomplete at codebase level

The intended architecture is:

```text
Creator payment
→ escrow
→ runner completes
→ creator confirms
→ direct Ozow bank payout
```

Wallet services, models, withdrawal models/DTOs and legacy references remain. They should be cleaned up so the retired architecture cannot accidentally be reused.

### 7. Payment transaction ID persistence

The payment flow receives provider transaction information, but the original Ozow transaction ID is not currently persisted as a first-class DFY financial record. This is needed for robust refunds and reconciliation.

### 8. Refund is incomplete

Current dispute resolution can select refund, but the backend deliberately does not mark the task as refunded.

Required production flow:

```text
Dispute
→ admin refund decision
→ persistent refund record
→ Ozow refund request
→ provider response/status
→ reconciliation/webhook
→ Refunded
```

The system must never mark funds refunded before provider confirmation.

### 9. Admin refund reporting

The current admin payment statistics use a hardcoded zero refund total. This must be replaced with persisted refund data.

### 10. Payout concurrency and late-status hardening

- PR #12 atomically claims pending payouts before provider submission.
- PR #13 prevents late provider notifications from downgrading an already completed/RunnerPaid payout.

These changes should be retained and reconciled into the final production branch after review/testing.

### 11. Legacy E2E scripts

Existing E2E scripts still contain wallet/withdrawal assumptions. They cannot be treated as proof of the current direct-bank architecture.

The replacement suite must test the complete creator → payment → escrow → runner → completion → bank payout → provider notification lifecycle plus all failure, concurrency, dispute and refund scenarios.

### 12. FE Playwright is not currently part of CI

The FE has Playwright infrastructure, but CI currently validates the build rather than executing the browser suite.

## Required remaining production work

### P0 — Financial integrity

1. Persist original Ozow payment transaction ID.
2. Implement persistent refund model/state.
3. Implement Ozow refund submission.
4. Implement refund idempotency.
5. Implement refund provider reconciliation/webhook.
6. Only mark funds refunded after provider confirmation.
7. Replace hardcoded refund reporting.
8. Complete payout failure/returned/retry state-machine review.

### P0 — Security / authorization

1. Reconcile task-detail authorization.
2. Require reasons for privileged admin financial actions.
3. Prevent financially relevant hard deletes.
4. Audit all financial state overrides.
5. Verify financial/admin endpoint ownership and role checks.

### P1 — FE/BE contract integrity

1. Create authoritative shared status definitions.
2. Align task, payment and payout status types.
3. Remove unsafe string aliases.
4. Remove unnecessary `any` usage in financial flows.
5. Align TaskName across create/list/detail/edit.
6. Remove obsolete wallet contracts.

### P1 — Testing

1. Replace obsolete wallet E2E scenarios.
2. Complete creator journey.
3. Complete runner journey.
4. Complete admin journey.
5. Test financial negative paths.
6. Test duplicate/concurrent events.
7. Test provider ambiguity.
8. Test disputes and refunds.
9. Run FE Playwright in CI.
10. Run backend automated tests.
11. Validate staging provider integrations.

### P1 — Operations

1. Add structured system failure logging/visibility.
2. Make payout/refund failures visible to administrators.
3. Add reconciliation visibility.
4. Add failed webhook visibility.
5. Add provider-reference/search tools.
6. Audit all manual financial actions.

## Production readiness gate

DFY should only be marked **Production Ready** when all are true:

- [ ] FE and BE financial contracts are aligned
- [ ] Required hardening PRs are reconciled/merged
- [ ] Ozow transaction IDs are persisted
- [ ] Refunds are implemented end-to-end
- [ ] Refunds are idempotent
- [ ] Refund status is provider-confirmed
- [ ] Payout retries are deterministic and duplicate-safe
- [ ] Legacy wallet flow cannot be accidentally invoked
- [ ] Admin financial overrides are reasoned and audited
- [ ] Financial records cannot be destructively deleted
- [ ] Creator E2E passes
- [ ] Runner E2E passes
- [ ] Admin E2E passes
- [ ] Payment failure scenarios pass
- [ ] Payout failure scenarios pass
- [ ] Dispute scenarios pass
- [ ] Refund scenarios pass
- [ ] Duplicate/concurrency scenarios pass
- [ ] FE Playwright runs in CI
- [ ] Backend tests pass
- [ ] Staging financial integration passes
- [ ] Production observability/reconciliation is available

## Bottom line

**Current DFY state: 🟡 Production hardening in progress.**

The direct-to-bank architecture is substantially implemented and important payout concurrency/idempotency protections have been developed. However, the system is not yet coherent enough to declare production-ready because refunds, provider transaction persistence, FE/BE state alignment, authorization/admin hardening, legacy-wallet cleanup, payout edge cases and full E2E validation remain.

This document is the baseline audit and should be updated as each production-readiness gate is completed.
